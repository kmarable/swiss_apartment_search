Relative import does not work when a script is called from a command line.  You need to add something to add the path to the command line.

for testing, the easiest way to proceed is to use the unittest command line interface that will take care of adding it for you.  See:

I guess somewhere when we set up the datafile i should make sure that the path is modified?

UNITTEST SETUP RUNS AGAIN BEFORE EACH TEST
For things you want to run once before running all the tests, use setUpClass and tearDownClass.
Wow, I did not understand how that works..

also possible to write subtests, that might be a good way to implement my parser testing code

Can also use skipTest() to avoid tests...

Class and static methods, was looking it up for teardownclass. but,
STATIC METHOD seems to be the right way to add little helper functions i.e. isAdult as part of a Person class.They cannot access/modify class state
CLASS METHODS can access or modify class state.  typically used for FACTORIES
