YAML strings are confusing.  There are basically four options


1) something: This is a string

default is to interpret things as strings unless they look like numbers, boolean etc.

2) something: !!str 1234
can force interpretation as a string even for things that look like numbers

3) something: "This is a formatted string\n"

Using double quotes allows slash escape sequences to be interpreted.

4) something: 'This is a string with special characters:@#$%'

Will be interpreted as a string with special characters with no escape sequences, EXCEPT ' must be escaped by doubling it like ''

4.5) |- indicates how to handle spaces/newlines.. in this case, keep newlines in the middle of the text rather than folding, and strip the newline at the end.

what I want is a way to directly copy paste html code and have it parsed correctly no matter what stupid character is in there without having to hunt for any quotes that are in there... This is probably not possible with a general purpose parser, since they need to pick a character to mark the end.  I could write my own that stops at END QUOTE.  Or, I can keep hunting for ' using my checking code to see which one breaks it

Oh for chrissake it was in my error message. ok.  Not sure why it was also throwing an error at input text line.  But I guess this just goes to show that more checking makes more sense than writing a parser.

5) Tabs are illegal too...
